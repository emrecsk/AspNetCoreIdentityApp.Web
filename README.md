## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a fully functional membership system using ASP.NET Core Identity. It provides user registration, login, logout, password management, and demonstrates how to implement role-based authorization within an ASP.NET Core MVC application.  A key feature is the integration of email services for password resets, enhancing the user experience and security. This project serves as a practical example of my understanding of security best practices, email integration, and my ability to develop secure and user-friendly web applications.

## Technical Stack

* **.NET Core:** .NET 7 and EntityFrameworkCore 7 versions used.
* **ASP.NET Core MVC:**  Implementation of the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
* **ASP.NET Core Identity:**  Framework for managing user authentication and authorization.
* **Entity Framework Core:**  Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for database interactions.
* **MSSQL Server:** Relational database management system.
* **email library:** System.Net.Mail

## Architecture

This project employs an all-in-one application architecture.  While it's a single project, the code is organized following MVC principles for separation of concerns within the application itself.

* **Models:** Contains the domain models, including user models that extend or customize the ASP.NET Core Identity user.
* **Views:**  Handles the user interface and presentation logic.
* **Controllers:** Manages user interactions and interacts with the Identity framework, the database, and the email service.

## Key Features

* **User Registration:**  Allows new users to create accounts.
* **User Login/Logout:**  Securely authenticates and logs out users.
* **Password Management:**  Provides functionality for users to reset forgotten passwords.
* **Role-Based Authorization:**  Implements role-based access control to restrict access to certain parts of the application.
* **Customizable User Profiles:**  Demonstrates how to extend the ASP.NET Core Identity user with custom properties.
* **Email Confirmation:**  Includes email confirmation for user registration.
* **Password Reset via Email:** Users can reset their passwords by receiving a verification email.

## Database Design

The database schema includes tables for users, roles, and user-role relationships, as managed by ASP.NET Core Identity.  The project demonstrates my understanding of database design principles related to identity management.

## Security

This project emphasizes security best practices, including:

* **Password Hashing:**  Uses strong password hashing algorithms provided by ASP.NET Core Identity.
* **Input Validation:**  Implements input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
* **Authorization:**  Uses role-based authorization to control access to resources.
* **Secure Email Handling:**  Follows best practices for sending emails securely (using secure SMTP connections).

## Email Integration

The project integrates an email service (e.g., Gmail) to facilitate password resets.  Users who forget their passwords can request a reset email containing a verification link. This demonstrates my ability to work with email services within a web application and implement a crucial part of user management.

## Future Enhancements

* **Improved UI/UX:**  Enhance the user interface and user experience.
* **Integration with External Authentication Providers:**  Integrate with social login providers (e.g., Google, Facebook).
* **More Advanced Authorization Scenarios:**  Implement more complex authorization rules.
* **Unit/Integration Testing:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
* **Email Templating:** Use email templates for more professional and branded emails.
